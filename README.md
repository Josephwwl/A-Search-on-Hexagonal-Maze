# A* Search Algorithm for Rubbish Collection Path Finding

</div>

# About
This python program is a python 3 Command Line Interface implementation of the A* search algorithm.

The main objective of this task is to create a search algorithm that is able to help Ronny to find the path to clear out all the rubbish by using a rubbish bin to carry and dispose the collected rubbish. Our implementation focuses on finding the optimal path with the lowest cost to clear the rubbish.

# Prerequisites
To run the program on your local machine or system, Python3 is required. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/) for further installation instructions. 

# Getting Started 
You may choose any of the below methods to setup the project environment.

1. Simply `git clone` this repository.

    git clone https://github.com/Josephwwl/A-Star-Search-on-Hexagonal-Maze

2. Copy the code in [`AI_Assignment.py`](https://github.com/Josephwwl/A-Star-Search-on-Hexagonal-Maze/blob/main/AI_assignment.py) into a `.py` file onto your system.

3. Copy the code in [`AI_Assignment.py`](https://github.com/Josephwwl/A-Star-Search-on-Hexagonal-Maze/blob/main/AI_assignment.py) into an [Online Python IDE](https://www.online-python.com/). 

No dependencies are needed to be installed as the program only uses standard Python libraries.

# Running the Program
To execute the program, open a terminal in the project's root directory and type in the following command:

    python AI_Assignment.py

Alternatively if your preferred IDE supports it or you are using the online IDE, just click on the run button.


# Program Execution Flow
After running the program, the results will be shown in the terminal in a textual format. Hence, no input is needed from the user.
